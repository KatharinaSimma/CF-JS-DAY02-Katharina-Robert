// Basic Exercise
/* Create a program that according to the temperature will provide you with the information, whether the weather is cold or moderate. This program should generate a different random number every time, that should be between -5c and 25c. If the temperature is between -5c and 10c print "The weather is cold" otherwise print "The weather is moderate".*/
